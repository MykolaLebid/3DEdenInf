1) We are working on ABC parameter inference of dynamical cancer models:

multi-type branching processes for cancer processes under the spatial conditions (3D - Eden Growth Model) and non-spatial conditions

2) Main goal is to achieve a "good" comparison measure between 2 phylogenetic trees for parameters inference and to use the results to NGS data
